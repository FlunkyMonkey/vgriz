# Zabbix Template Instructions

This is a guide for configuring Zabbix monitoring for FamilyCabin.io.
You will need to import this template into your Zabbix server.

Template includes:
- Host monitoring for API and Frontend pods
- Web scenario to check application health endpoints
- Trigger for service unavailability
- Custom dashboard for FamilyCabin.io metrics

Steps for configuration:
1. Log in to your Zabbix web interface
2. Go to Configuration > Templates
3. Click "Import"
4. Upload the zabbix-template.xml file (you will need to create this from the Zabbix export functionality)
5. Apply the template to your FamilyCabin.io host

Note: The actual XML template should be exported from your existing Zabbix system and customized for FamilyCabin.io.
